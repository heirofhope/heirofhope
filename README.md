My name is Collin Campbell and online I go by some variation of The Heir of Hope.

I am currently working on a medium scale Minecraft mod along with projects for my college classes.

I go to Wright State University and am majoring in computer science with a goal of landing in game development.

You can contact me on discord under the username theheirofhope.
